**DairyComp Health Analysis** 

DairyComp is the most popular dairy herd management application on the market. DairyComp maintains individual cow records and provides herd-level tracking for reproduction, milk production, and other features.

Herd health analysis using DairyComp has been a major challenge for veterinarians and dairy producers. Previous methods to evaluate herd health trends required extensive knowledge of DairyComp and a large time commitment each time the herd analysis was performed.

This Rshiny application was created to address these challenges by minimizing the time required for initial setup and reducing it to a button click for future uses. The app automates data processing and simplifies data analysis through a point-and-click interface.
